# SpotCorgi

Development/testing code for 3D printed robot dog SpotCorgi at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3900070

V.3 is the version used in the video "SpotCorgi Says Hello" on the channel below.

V.6.1 is a much revised version for a new IR remote control including functions for 35 buttons plus new lower leg move algorithm to keep the body height constant during leg moves. However, I think there is a + sign where there should be a -sign in the code so results may vary. I'll post a fix when I find the gremlin. 

Servo numbers used in the code are Lower/Upper Leg: FrontRight 0/4, FrontLeft 1/5, RearLeft 2/6, RearRight 3/7.

Sorry, still too much monitoring code and still too few explanatory comments. Will be updated, again.
