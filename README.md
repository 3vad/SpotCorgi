# SpotCorgi

Please ignore comments about a major redesign. This is still being considered and may not go ahead. Hence, this code IS still current.

Development/testing code for 3D printed robot dog SpotCorgi at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3900070

This is the version used in the video "SpotCorgi Says Hello" on the channel below.

Servo numbers used in the code are Lower/Upper Leg: FrontRight 0/4, FrontLeft 1/5, RearLeft 2/6, RearRight 3/7.

Sorry, too much monitoring code and too few explanatory comments. Will be updated.
