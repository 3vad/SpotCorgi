# SpotCorgi

******************************************************************************
Due to a design revision this code will no longer be current for the new design. The PCA9685 is being removed due to power output limits and the design is reverting to using a Mega and Sensor Shield. This will mean changing to using servo.h and servo.write in place of the PWM commands. I will update ASAP.

Development/testing code for 3d printed robot dog SpotCorgi at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3900070

This is the version used in the video SpotCorgi Says Hello on the channel below.

Sorry, too much monitoring code and too few explanatory comments. Will be updated.
