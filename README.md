# SpotCorgi

Development/testing code for 3D printed robot dog SpotCorgi at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3900070

V.3 is the version used in the video "SpotCorgi Says Hello" on the channel below.

V.6.1 is a much revised version for a new IR remote control including functions for 35 buttons plus new lower leg move algorithm to keep the body height constant during leg moves. However, I think there is a + sign where there should be a -sign in the code so results may vary. I'll post a fix when I find the gremlin. 

V.6.2 is an updated version which makes SpotCorgi walk as well as doing the moves shown in "SpotCorgi Says Hello".  You can see it in operation in the very brief video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5pyreFI-OY
I'm going to produce a video on my Youtube channel explaining the code and how to use it for testing/development.
I used an old digital set-top box remote control. You will need to alter the Case HEX codes to match the remote you use.

V.6.3 code cleanup and added comments.

Servo numbers used in the code are Lower/Upper Leg: FrontRight 0/4, FrontLeft 1/5, RearLeft 2/6, RearRight 3/7.

Will be updated, again.
